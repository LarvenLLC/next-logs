# next-logs

> lightning fast, local server and client side logger for NextJS, NodeJS and JS Applications and Servers.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/next-logs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-logs) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save next-logs
```

Or

```bash
yarn add next-logs
```

### Logs are written under `/tmp/` in the project directory:

## Usage - Logging

### 1. Add API in `/pages/api/logger/[log].js`
```jsx
// /pages/api/logger/[log].js
import {NextLogs} from "next-logs";

export default NextLogs();
```

### 2. Client Side
The client side API uses API routes hence it works in both: client and server side.

```jsx
// /pages/*.js
import log from "next-logs";

export default Page() {
  useEffect(() => {
    log.info("Created our super logger!", {
      name: "next-logs"
    });
    log.debug("Created our super logger!", {
      name: "next-logs"
    });
    log.warn("Created our super logger!", {
      name: "next-logs"
    });
    log.error("Created our super logger!", {
      name: "next-logs"
    });
  },[]);

  return (
    <div />
  )
};
```

### 3. Server Side
## Setup - Next Config
Next logs ships with a server side API that makes logging more efficient.

```jsx
// in your helper function eg. /helper/logger
import {Logger} from "next-logs";

// Logger API takes in directory as a parameter - defaults to /tmp
// It is optimal to have the same directory for the client and server side APIs
// However this API gives you freedom to have different directories for client side and server side logs
const logger = Logger("logs");

export default logger;
```

```jsx
// /pages/api/auth.js || /middleware.js
import {logger} from "../../helper/logger"; // import from your helper file

async function handler(req, res) {
  const { method } = req;

  logger.info("Deleting user with attributes:", {
    id: '1'
  });

  logger.debug("Deleting user with attributes:", {
    id: '1'
  });

  logger.warn("Deleting user with attributes:", {
    id: '1'
  });

  logger.error("Deleting user with attributes:", {
    id: '1'
  });

  try {
    switch (method) {
      case 'DELETE':
        // delete user
        break;
      default:
        res.setHeader('Allow', ['DELETE']);
        res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
    }
    // send result
    return res.status(200).json({});
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json(error);
  }
}
```

## Setup - Next Config
Next logs works by using nodeJS functions inside API routes to write and read logs. This functionality is not enabled for Client Side applications. To enable the Client Side APIs to effectively communicate with the nodeJS functions, please install `process` via npm/yarn/pnpm and add this setup in your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // ...
  webpack5: true, // if using webpack 5
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      fs: false,
      path: false,
      constants: false,
      process: require.resolve('process/browser'),
    };

    return config;
  },
  // ...
}

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Monitoring & Debugging
You can view logs by type through your `domain/api/logger/{type}`. Type of logs include `info`, `debug`, `warn` and `error`.
You can also build your own log viewers through the same API that returns log text. A next-logs logs dashboard is currently in development.

## Logs directory/location
By default, logs are saved in the `/tmp` directory. Because Vercel and most systems allow saving files under `/tmp` directory; hence prevents conflicts that may lead to failures.

This configuration can be edited when initializing `NextLogs` API in the `/pages/api/logger/[log].js` file:
```jsx
// /pages/api/logger/[log].js
import {NextLogs} from "next-logs";

// logs will be saved in the /logs directory
export default NextLogs({ dir: 'logs' });
```
When self-hosting a NextJS project, it is advised to change the logs location from the default `'tmp'` for better control of logs.

## NextJS Middleware
While using nextJS middleware in API routes, make sure that your middleware does not block requests at `/api/logger/` routes. This may lead to errors and malfunctioning while using `next-logs`.
